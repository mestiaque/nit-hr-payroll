/**
 * "Day Swap" (a.k.a. Replace Off) — factory-wide compensatory day-off swap.
 *
 * The office stays open on worked_date (normally a weekend/holiday) and everyone
 * takes their compensatory day off on replace_date instead. Applying a swap:
 *   1. Force-moves every employee's hr_attendances row for worked_date onto
 *      replace_date, recalculating OT against each employee's own shift as
 *      resolved for replace_date — the moved day is treated exactly like a
 *      regular working day. A payroll lock covering worked_date does not block
 *      the move. A pre-existing attendance row already on replace_date (e.g. a
 *      stray punch already there) is left alone and the move is skipped for
 *      HR to resolve manually — every other employee's move still proceeds.
 *   2. Leaves worked_date permanently blocked (see the active-swap check added to
 *      AttendanceMachineController::applyPunchToAttendance()) so a later machine
 *      sync can never re-introduce attendance/salary impact on that date.
 *
 * This intentionally does NOT auto-reverse an already-applied move on cancel — by
 * the time someone cancels a swap, replace_date's attendance may already have been
 * viewed/edited/paid against, so blindly moving it back could silently corrupt
 * unrelated changes. Cancelling only lifts the worked_date block for future syncs.
